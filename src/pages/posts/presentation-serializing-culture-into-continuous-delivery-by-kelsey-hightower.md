I’m recommending this video because I haven’t seen a good one for a while that reflected how I typically approach understanding an organization within 90 days being in management, and Kelsey presented it in a clear and concise manner. 

If you have serialized a culture effectively and improved the processes / tools surrounding it cultivating change whilst keeping the abstracted "front door" the same -- maintaining / reducing overhead, reach out to me via the [contact](https://thebility.engineer/contact/) form and tell me your story over a meal or coffee.
