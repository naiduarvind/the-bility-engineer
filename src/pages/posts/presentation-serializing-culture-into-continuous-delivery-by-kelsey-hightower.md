I’m recommending this video because I haven’t seen a good one for a while that reflected how I typically approach understanding an organization within 90 days being in management, and Kelsey presented it in a clear and concise manner.

If you are new to the concept or would like a refresher, here are a few things to take note of:

* practice > best-practice
* serializing decisions
* practical, incremental steps
* keep the "front door" the same for internal users



If you have serialized a culture effectively and improved the processes / tools surrounding it cultivating change whilst keeping the abstracted "front door" the same -- maintaining / reducing overhead, reach out to me via the [contact](https://thebility.engineer/contact/) form and tell me your story over a meal or coffee.
