I’m recommending this video because I haven’t seen a good one for a while that reflected how I typically approach understanding an organization within 90 days being in management, and Kelsey presented it in a clear and concise manner.

If you are new to the concept or would like a refresher, here are a few things to take note of:

* practice > best-practice
* serializing decisions
* practical, incremental steps
* keep the "front door" the same for internal users

By keeping in mind the takeaways above while serializing culture, one can easily and quickly acquire the techniques techniques for getting people comfortable with new tools and automation!

If you have serialized a culture effectively and improved the processes / tools surrounding it cultivating change whilst keeping the abstracted "front door" the same -- maintaining / reducing overhead, reach out to me via the [contact](https://thebility.engineer/contact/) form and tell me your story over a meal or coffee.
