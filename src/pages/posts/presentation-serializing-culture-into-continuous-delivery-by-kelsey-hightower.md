> If you’re an executive, and you want to learn what is *likely happening inside your own company* today around your culture of software delivery (and the benefits you’d get by serializing that culture), this is a must-watch video.

I’m recommending this video because I haven’t seen a good one for a while that reflected how I typically approach understanding an organization within 90 days being in management, and Kelsey presented it in a clear and concise manner.

If you are new to the concept or would like a refresher, here are a few things to take note of:

* `practice > "best practice"`
* `serializing decisions`
* `practical, incremental steps of change`
* `same "front door" for internal users (cross-departments)`

By keeping in mind the takeaways above while serializing culture, one can easily and quickly acquire the techniques for getting people comfortable with new tools and automation!

A few quotes from [Kelsey Hightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) that completely resonated with my previous approaches on serializing culture for organizations I have worked for are:

* Give them a tarball, not a container!

  *
* Add an egg, they want to make the cake!

  *
* Tell a story, everyone loves a story.

  *
* Where is the ticket? It's the front door.

  *
* Get the front door right!

  *

I have found repeated success in serializing culture to drive process improvements at work, [](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/view-and-understand-the-control-chart/)through <strike>Spinnaker</strike> any tool that already exists within the realm of the organization. Charity Majors also incidentally happens to mention something similar:

But if a certain tool neither exists or works as intended, one should drive the adoption of a new tool that satisfies the previous and current requirements to minimize chaos presented in change -- as claimed by [Satir's Change Model](http://dhemery.com/articles/managing_yourself_through_change/).

While there’s a lack of homogeneity in the data which represents our culture, it is still helpful to understand the software development lifecycle (SDLC) process or the performance of a service desk. 

One way I have recently discovered on not only exploring the current SDLC process in place but rather every aspect affected by the organization's structure is through an [exploratory mindmap](https://www.kartar.net/2020/07/vpe-and-cto-the-first-90-days/) by [James Turnbull](https://twitter.com/kartar) which has made its way into my management tool belt.

If you have serialized a culture effectively and improved the processes / tools surrounding it cultivating change whilst keeping the abstracted "front door" the same -- maintaining / reducing overhead, reach out to me via the [contact](https://thebility.engineer/contact/) form and tell me your story over a meal or coffee.
