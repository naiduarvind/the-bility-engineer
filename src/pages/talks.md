    content: >-
      The best way to ask me to speak at your conference is to book a time
      [](https://calendly.com/arvind-naidu/talk-by-arvind)[here](https://thebility.engineer/contact/)
      and include the following information:


      * What is the name of the event?

      * What is the best link to find out more about the event?

      * What is your name and contact information?

      * What type of presentation you have in mind?

      * Anything else you want!


      These events go directly to a private account that I own. I receive push notifications, so I assure you - I will see this request. It might take a while to get back to you, so please be patient.
